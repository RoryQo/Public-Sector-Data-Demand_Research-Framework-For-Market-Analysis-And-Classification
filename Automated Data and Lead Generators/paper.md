# Summary

The forces on stars, galaxies, and dark matter under external gravitational
fields lead to the dynamical evolution of structures in the universe. The orbits
of these bodies are therefore key to understanding the formation, history, and
future state of galaxies. The field of "galactic dynamics," which aims to model
the gravitating components of galaxies to study their structure and evolution,
is now well-established, commonly taught, and frequently used in astronomy.
Aside from toy problems and demonstrations, the majority of problems require
efficient numerical tools, many of which require the same base code (e.g., for
performing numerical orbit integration).

# Statement of need

The demand for external data in businesses has grown exponentially across industries. While we know this demand exists, public procurement records are often unavailable or do not identify the roles or departments responsible for purchasing. This lack of transparency leads to market inefficiencies where data vendors cannot reliably connect with or identify their clients. 

This project addresses that inefficiency by creating a reproducible framework to estimate this demand through job descriptions in available position postings and outputs a ranked list of job titles and agencies by their likelihood of being data buyers- enabling researchers and data vendors to identify likely clients and then prioritize their outreach based on their scores.
