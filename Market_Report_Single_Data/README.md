##  Data Access & Reproducibility

The data used in this analysis is included in this repository, but **requires [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/)** to be properly accessed.

To use the data and fully replicate the results:

- Make sure Git LFS is installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository using Git (do **not** use the "Download ZIP" option).
- Once cloned, Git LFS will automatically retrieve all large data files.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> If you download the repository as a ZIP file *or* do not have Git LFS installed,  
> large data files will appear as plain pointer text files and will not contain usable data.
